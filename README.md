NeonAscent is a simplistic game with a neon arcade scheme, touch the right half of the screen to advance right and touch the left half of the screen to go left. Your objective is to reach the wormhole and ascend to the next stage, while dodging the falling neon particles. For every neon ascension you reach, the level gets faster and more difficult. How high can you ascend?
